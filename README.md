# Team Cheatah's Side Project

Our team decided to create an autonomous AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) with a robotic arm as a side project before starting the main project. 
We plan to begin with hardware design using CAD(Computer Aided Design) and move on to tasks like learning to recognize signs and traffic lights. Additionally, we aim to train the robotic arm to sort recyclable waste, creating a recycling robot arm. 
As part of this process, we plan to use sensors like LiDAR, which we’ve wanted to try, and incorporate BLDC motors. Through these activities, we hope to assess everyone's skills before the main project and ensure a smoother execution of the main project.
